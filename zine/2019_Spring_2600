    Hello from Germany! I have read the article “Scrape Textbooks, Save Money” by th0tnet
in the Autumn 2017 issue and was impressed by the creative solution for a problem. I had a
similar issue with documentation from a training course of a big network equipment company.
They provided a lot of documentation during the training, but you can only read it with their
special software. With this software you can’t copy anything from the document to your clip-
board. They added the ability to print pages, but only a certain amount. If you hit the maximum
of allowed pages to print, you can just make screenshots of it. I have used the script from the
above mentioned article as a basis for my own script to easily copy the interesting pages. This is
the kind of article I love to read in 2600. The other type is about details of infrastructures in other
countries (e.g. telephone network, Internet, or anything else) - thank you “Telecom Informer!”
    In Germany we have a lot of public libraries from universities or local authorities in which
you can lend books or magazine for free or for a very small yearly fee of around ten euros. It’s
also possible to get a book from another library if your local one doesn’t have it. The other library
will send the book to your local library for a small fee of two euros. I use these kinds of libraries
a lot to get the newest novels or magazines and save some money.
    Some years ago, the local authorities library introduced the ability to lend digital media like
ebooks, magazines, or audio books. Not every small local authorities library can operate such an
expensive digital media library by themselves, and therefore a lot of local authorities libraries get
together and build a shared digital library.
    Two main digital libraries are in use in my state of Germany (Lower Saxony): Lies-e and
Onleihe (combination of Online and Leihe - lend). My local authorities library is part of the
Onleihe which they named NBib24 (Niedersachsische Bibliotheken 24 Stunden online - Lower
Saxony Libraries 24 hours online). The digital library is a service made by divibib GmbH. Unfor-
tunately, the whole system has a lots of bugs and they must use some kind of DRM to prevent
easy sharing and enforce the duration of lend.
    The DRM comes from Adobe and I have to use Adobe Digital Edition to download the digital
media. Also, the number of available copies of digital media is limited. Sometimes you have to
wait some days or even weeks for new popular books or magazines until you can lend it. Maga-
zines are allowed to lend for one day and usually one or up to five copies of the magazine are
available at the same time. To be able to lend the magazine as soon as possible, it’s a good idea to
lend the magazine quickly after it appears in the online database of the digital media library. It’s a
boring task to check every day or even every hour for a new issue of your favorite magazine. For
this reason, I have created a small shell script which searches the online database of the digital
library for the magazine and sorts it by newest arrival. If a new issue is available, it will send a
push notification to my smartphone and I can lend it.

    The European Commission releases every week on Friday the latest product warnings as
the Rapid Alert System for dangerous non-food products (https://ec.europa.eu/
➥consumers/consumers_safety/safety_products/rapex/alerts/repo
➥sitory/content/pages/rapex/index_en.htm). I was on their mailing list and
looked at the picture on the website for products I have bought. It takes some time to scroll the
whole webpage on my smartphone. To make my life easier, I have created a web scraping script
which download the website and extracted the URLs of the pictures. These URLs are then sent
as an HTML email to me. With this email, I can quickly check the products and, if I have such a
product, look up the details about the warning.

   A smaller web scraping script downloads Internet radio episodes from a public station in
Germany late at night. I can then hear it the next morning during my commute to work.

   All these scripts are written in Bash and use standard Unix tools. They are quick and dirty
and I need usually 15 to 60 minutes for each. They all run on my Raspberry Pi 2 with Cron. For
push notification, I use the great service from Pushover (pushover.net). As a starting point, I
often open the web page with Firefox Developer Tools. In the Developer Tools, I use the Selector

         to Call Anyplace Home

    In this tiny article, I will show you a workaround that can be helpful in situations when you
need to run some types of applications in machines that cannot be updated and also are not able
to build any kind of software natively. Maybe the software is too new, maybe the system is too
old, and vice versa. With this approach, you are be able in most cases to execute a self-contained
binary package in several systems having different versions of libraries, without any updating
necessity.

                                         Introduction
   Sometimes it is necessary to run an application in several different versions/distributions of
an operating system, especially Linux. The problem with this issue is that the compiled program
cannot be successfully executed in all machines because the libraries will vary from one OS
version to another.
   Updating in practice tends to be a tedious bureaucratic task for some large production environ-
ments. You can’t always just run an updating task. In most cases, you need to plan it in advance,
ask/inform a couple of departments, convince the customer, and so on....

                What About Carrying Your Home on Your Shoulders?
    This is not always the better solution, but in some cases it can be a nice workaround. The
idea is basically to compile the software once and scan the related dependency libraries in order
to collect all of them. Afterwards, what you should do is distribute the binary and the libraries
together.
    You need to recompile and some care about this recompilation must be observed.

                    How Can I Find All Dependencies of Software?
    You should use the environment variable called “LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS” when
calling the application:
LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS=1 ./app
   When executed, a list of all libraries will be shown on the console. These libraries should be
copied and distributed together with your software.

                                 Recompiling the Software
   When recompiling the software, you need to pass to the compiler two important options:
“-rpath” and “-dynamic-linker”.
   The “-rpath” option specifies the directory where the libraries should be searched during the
executable loading.
   The “-dynamic-linker” is related to the dynamic linker loader and is actually a linker flag.
   In GCC the basic command line would be:
gcc -rpath <directory> -Wl,
➥ -dynamic-linker=<directory>
   The better choice is let “-rpath” and “-dynamic-linker” point to the same directory, which
should be a directory where you will create and copy all dependencies and binaries and execute
the application from there.
   Notice that the compilation command line shown is for software written in C or C++. In
other languages that generate ELF, this technique will also work, but the method of setting up
the “-rpath” and “-dynamic-linker” may be different. Try to google for more information on this.
  Page 18                                                                     2600 Magazine
                       Automating the Generation of the Package
    I have written a shell script (Bash-based) that can scan executables and also libraries. This
script collects and compresses the dependencies, making it ready for distribution. It also uses
some other minor techniques that I will abstract for the sake of brevity.
    The usage of this script is as follows:
./snail.sh --directory <path
➥ containing the binaries to be
➥ scanned> --output <zip out>
   Once the “-rpath” and “-dynamic-linker” are configured after a recompilation, all that you
should do is deploy the zipped dependencies along with the executables and libraries. The impor-
tant thing here is to extract the dependencies to the directory where the “-rpath” is pointing.
Again: the better choice is to let “-rpath” and “-dynamic-linker” point to the same directory.
   In the code listing below, you can see the entire shell script. Some users will need to adjust the
shebang path according to their systems. You can download the script at https://github.

            @@@ - done.
@@@ - done.
@@@ - Zipping all collected dependencies into test.zip... ok.
@@@ - done.

    As you can see, this output indicates that the subdirectory “test” was scanned and three
executables were found: “lex”, “morse”, and “vi”. The libraries “libc.so.7”, “libutil.so.9”, and
“libncursesw.so.8” were copied and zipped into test.zip. The zip file and the executables (already
recompiled) can be successfully executed in other systems with different library versions without
any update necessary over there.

                                           Conclusion
     This approach is a good way of solving little problems with software deployment, especially
in operating systems that come with several distributions - and with each distribution having
little changes in some shared libraries (a.k.a. Linux XYZ*). These little changes tend to make the
software incompatible from one version to another.
     Originally, I wrote this script facing deployment problems in Linux, but it could be extended
to other UNIX environments.
     I think that the above technique should not be applied in software related to information secu-
rity, since it can open possibilities of library hooking.
     You always should think of this technique as a simple MacGyver workaround, a last resort,
“people stop calling me,” and so on.

                A Guide to ALKEMI
                                      by Ronald Gans

    This article is about my program, ALKEMI, which I recently completed.
    ALKEMI encrypts your text data up to 12,000 characters and in most languages to the format
of HEXASCII, an ASCII representation of binary data. So, for instance, the hexadecimal value
0xFE (which is 254 in decimal) would be represented as “FE” (without the quotes). The hexa-
decimal value 0x27 would be “27”. All 8-bit binary data (that is, data values like 10010110) can
be represented as two letter hexadecimal values. The binary value 00001001, which is decimal 9,
would be represented as “09”, and so forth.
    Here’s how it works: Type or paste text into the Original Text box up to 12,000 characters.
Any language that uses characters is OK, including Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic,
English, etc.




                                               \




   Choose your key. This is the key you can share with your friends. It can be up to 32,765 char-
acters long and, again, any character set is OK:




   Then just click the right-pointing arrow:
  Spring 2019                                                                        Page 31
     Being just text, it can be sent anywhere text can be sent, like Twitter, email, etc. You can tweet
your followers with the Alkemized text and, since only they have the key, only they can decrypt
it. Text data, of course, is just data like anything else.
     In today’s world, snooping is nearly ubiquitous. Not only do the intelligence agencies of
various countries examine data (mostly in transmission), but so do many email providers, mostly
to monetize your communications. So I wrote ALKEMI to help protect communications from
such snooping. ALKEMI uses an encryption format I created between 2005 and 2018, about
which I wrote an article published in 2600 in 2015.
     The encryption is not mathematical, unlike AES and others. It relies upon 64 routines which
are called hundreds of thousands up to millions of times. Routines do things like XOR a byte
array, or take a byte array and move lower or upper nibble around the array. Mostly it works on a
subset of a read array. It might take a subset of that:
void rotateArrayLeftAsBits(ref byte[] inB)
 {
   if (inB.Length == 0) return;
   byte[] outB = new byte[inB.Length];
   byte[] bits = new byte[inB.Length];

 int i;
 for (i = 0; i < inB.Length; i++)
 {
   if ((inB[i] & 0x80) == 0x80)
    bits[i] = 1; //save the high bit for later
   outB[i] = (byte)(inB[i] << 1);
➥ //SHIFT LEFT ONE

     }

     //now add in the saved high bits
     for (i = 1; i < inB.Length; i++)
      outB[i - 1] |= bits[i];
     outB[inB.Length - 1] |= bits[0];

 //copy back into inB
 System.Buffer.BlockCopy(outB, 0,
➥ inB, 0, inB.Length);

 }

   Some procedures create a byte array based
on the values from the key, others from a
“matrix” like extraction:

  Page 32                                                                         2600 Magazine
    The black rectangle represents a possible “matrix,” that is, extracted data, which is clearly not
completely sequential. It will start at some offset into the read buffer, run so long, then go to the next
“line” (not a real line but some designated amount; this graphic only helps visualize the process).
    Some byte extractions take data from the read buffer parameter in a more disjointed fashion:




   The reads (of the original text data) are prepended with pseudorandom characters using:
byte[] b = new byte[sizeofRandomData];
new RNGCryptoServiceProvider().GetNonZeroBytes(b);
   Since the Microsoft TextBox control supports a large number of character sets, ALKEMI can encrypt
Chinese and other languages the same way:




    I think I’ve made ALKEMI easy to use. When you encrypt (or decrypt), the data is also placed in
your clipboard so you can, in two steps, encrypt and paste into a communication program. The same with
the key. When you create the key, it is also placed in your clipboard as soon as you close the dialog box
so it’s easy to save (like with Notepad or Notepad++) and communicate it to your friends.
    ALKEMI does not protect its process from side channel attacks. There is some code which is there
to mislead intruders, but not a lot. I think I’ve protected the executable from reverse engineering to
the extent any code can be protected. At one time I used Confuser, which I thought was quite good,
but Windows flagged the confused app as malware. I use another protection app called the Phoenix
Protector.
    I hope you take a look at the executable alkemi.exe and find that it might be quite useful - I’m
thinking specifically for people in countries where the government is not all that friendly. ALKEMI can
also hide data from eager monetizers like Verizon and Google.
    I welcome any criticism, comments, flames, kisses, whatever.
    The ALKEMI website is at alkemized.com. I’m working on a Facebook page which is at:
www.facebook.com/Alkemi-301561457306680/.
    The name ALKEMI means nothing. I just sort of like it. I have been writing code since the mid-
1980s, starting with assembly language, C, C++, C#, etc., mostly in the financial sector in New York
City.

                 “Display the Planet” Is the New “Hack the Planet”
    Welcome to the year 2019, where more energy is being used to mine Bitcoins than all the solar power
generated. In addition to the planet melting down or constantly on fire, there are a few other problems that
relate to the weather and air quality that have come up recently. Yahoo, which is now owned by Oath (a
Verizon subsidiary), shut down their weather service for developers. As of Thursday, Jan. 3, 2019, the
weather.yahooapis.com and query.yahooapis.com URLs for the Yahoo Weather API were retired, a first for
sunsetting websites containing sunset times. Perhaps they realized we no longer have weather, and are now
spending time with family or something. This means if you made your own weather apps you need to find
another provider. Weather Underground was supposed to be the alternative for communities that wanted to
share weather data - they let anyone set up a weather station to upload data - and was a service a lot of us used.
However, as of May 2018, free keys are no longer available for the Weather Underground API. Weather.
com (a.k.a. “The Weather Company”) bought Weather Underground. And IBM happens to own The Weather
Company (ibm.com/weather). So yes, IBM now owns the weather, and pushed all the data hackers out.
Say this out loud around fellow hackers and see the response: “Do you trust IBM with the weather?”
    Open APIs (like Yahoo and Weather Underground used to have) allow us to freely use the data from the
Internet of Things to create useful interactive devices. Especially for the modern world with common extreme
weather like hurricanes, floods, statewide fires, and industrial city air quality, knowing the weather is more
than “do I need an umbrella today?”. Ironically, a case could be made that all of us paid for these weather
and environmental sensors and services over the decades - the data is almost all government-sourced. IBM
doesn’t have weather stations around the country; they use the federal and state government weather reports
and satellite images. Since we paid for it communally, we should have some free access to the data.
    Ironically, giving a simple text-only data endpoint for users to query would cost less than the service cost
of visiting the fancy websites. Going to a website just to check weather means ads, spam, pop-ups, newsletter
signups, tracking, cookies, a page load that is larger than the entire source code of Doom. But that’s the trick
- the data that we ought to have access to is now monetized. Checking weather on your phone now includes
a free trip to Facebook for your personal location data.
    While it’s possible to scrape weather.com to extract the data you want, it’s total overkill when making
a small embedded project. (Also, we’ve noticed a lot of websites are starting to have so much JavaScript, it’s
impossible to get data out unless you have a full Chromium engine.
    On our search for the next weather API, we found OpenWeatherMap (openweathermap.org). You
do need an API key, but it’s free to sign up, and you get a generous 60 calls per minute. The API is nice
and clean, with a REST URL that contains the API key and all options, no OAuth or bearer certificate - for
example, https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=NewYork will
get back the weather via JSON (JavaScript object notation syntax). As an aside: thankfully, we’ve noticed
almost all APIs nowadays are JSON rather than XML, which is a blessing for microcontrollers and other
memory-constrained devices, thanks to the compact, well-defined grammar. Despite the name containing
“Javascript,” there are easy to use parser libraries available for Arduino and Python.
    For our example, we’re going to check in on the weather in Middle Island, New York 11953 (the home of
2600). Once we’ve gotten the data, we’re going to use Python to display it on a screen that sits on our desk.
That’s all it will do - no hidden microphone in the device like Google Nest, Amazon Alexa, or Apple Siri - just
100 percent open source software, and a hardware device that we can inspect. And no open ports to listen on
that can get hacked. Python is also a high enough level of abstraction that, when and if something changes,
there will be another JSON API to use. (That’s pretty much the only way to keep from going bonkers when
designing with APIs - assume they will go away.)

    Start by registering an account on OpenWeatherMap and get your API key. You can test in your browser
by querying the Middle Island zip code. (Our key is removed, so put your key there.)
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=11953,us&appid=YOUR-
➥KEY-HERE
In your browser window, you’ll get back something like:
{“coord”:{“lon”:-72.94,”lat”:40.88},”weather”:[{“id”:701,”main”:”Mist”,
➥”description”:”mist”,”icon”:”50d”},{“id”:741,”main”:”Fog”,”description
➥”:”fog”,”icon”:”50d”}],”base”:”stations”,”main”:{“temp”:279.55,
➥”pressure”:995,”humidity”:87,”temp_min”:279.15,”temp_max”:280.15},
➥”visibility”:1207,”wind”:{“speed”:5.7,”deg”:240},”clouds”:{“all”:90},
➥”dt”:1551045780,”sys”:{“type”:1,”id”:4128,”message”:0.0048,”country”:
➥”US”,”sunrise”:1551007940,”sunset”:1551047875},”id”:420028625,”name”:
➥”Islip”,”cod”:200}
    This is pretty human readable. You can start to see where you’ll get the names and values for what you’ll
want to display.
    You can use desktop Python 3 to start extracting data. We assume you have Python 3 installed, and also
have installed the “requests” library. Start by getting the data from online:
>>> import requests
>>> r = requests.get(‘https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?
➥zip=11953,US&appid=YOUR-KEY-HERE’)
    Python has a nice JSON parser built in that will give you a dictionary (arbitrary-key indexed array). Once
converted/parsed, you can traverse the JSON path by name. For example, if you want to get the description
of the current weather, run:
>>> j = r.json()
>>> j[‘weather’][0][‘description’]
‘mist’
    For some reason, the temperature is in Kelvin, but you can easily convert it to Celsius:
>>> j[‘main’][‘temp’] - 273.15
6.33
    Our only complaint is that the time is in UTC seconds:
>>> j[‘dt’]
1551050040
    which is annoying if you have a device that doesn’t have a battery backup real time clock (why should you
when you have Internet?). So we like to use a separate API called worldtimeapi.org to get the UNIX
time in the current time zone. This API is nifty in that it will use your public facing IP address to geolocate
your time zone - no API key required:
>>> r = requests.get(‘http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip’)
>>> r.json()
➥[‘datetime’]
‘2019-02-24T18:45:
➥12.977139-05:00’
    Once you have that data
in plain text format, you
can craft a display, using a
simple character LCD or
a color TFT. For our little
single-serving device we
made, we added a 2600 van
as the background image, so
we can at a glance see the
weather in Middle Island,
New York.
    Good night and good
luck.

                         There’s no way you could have seen it all,
                        whether you were there or not. We can help.

      As is our tradition, we have an archive of all of the talks that were given at this year’s
      HOPE conference. There are far too many to list here, but suffice to say, we have more
     content than ever before - all in high quality HD recordings. The efforts of the folks over
       at the Internet Society and our amazing A/V team make all of this archiving possible.

                           We’re making these available in three ways:

 •     Full sets of all talks in MP4 format, no DRM, easy to copy, for $89 on more than one
       thumb drive (we’re at that awkward stage somewhere between 128GB and 256GB).
 •     On DVD, where a full set of over 100 DVDs now costs only $99
       (previously $249) or 99 cents per DVD (previously $2.99). Find a full listing
       at xii.hope.net or on our store.
 •     For download directly from store.2600.com at 59 cents a talk -
       you get the same MP4s that would come on the thumb drives, but you can choose the
       ones you want and not have to deal with any hardware.

      Looking for HOPE shirts? Sorry, we sold out at the conference for the first time ever!
            But we have plenty of other cool things like our 2019 Hacker Calendar,
                            2600 baseball caps, hoodies, etc., etc.

Bulgaria. A common sight in Sofia, and a card- Norway. Possibly the northernmost phone booth

Colombia. A typical street phone in Bogota, New Zealand. This one wins the prize for the biggest

                                                           well-earned complaint about high
                                                          rents. In actuality, it turns out to be

                                                             country to let people know that

                                                             they’re still needed for them to

  This was seen in the
Pacific Palace Mall on
